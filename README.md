# Neuro
***A simple single-layer perceptron for character recognition, written in C++ totally from scratch***

----------
`Neuro.h` - neuron core library  
`Bitmap.h` - bitmap reading library (24-bit .bmp)

Neuro.h library was written for single-layer perceptron, but if you wish, you can modify it for building deeper networks.
